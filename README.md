# Automatically categorizing Sinhala news items from selected news sources

## Introduction
Welcome to our GitHub repository for automatically categorizing Sinhala news items from selected sources. Our project aims to develop a robust and accurate classification model specifically designed for the Sinhala language, one of Sri Lanka's official languages.

With the rapid generation of news content, it has become increasingly challenging for individuals to keep up with the latest information. Our project seeks to address this by automatically categorizing Sinhala news articles into predefined categories such as politics, sports, entertainment, technology, business, and health.

Using state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, we will build a system that can analyze Sinhala news articles and assign them to relevant categories. The project will involve collecting a substantial dataset of Sinhala news articles, annotating them with categories, and training a classification model.

Throughout the project, we will explore various NLP techniques for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model selection to achieve optimal performance. We will also address language-specific challenges in Sinhala, such as tokenization and handling morphological variations.

By the end of this project, we aim to create an efficient and accurate system for automatically categorizing Sinhala news items. This repository serves as a collaborative platform, providing access to code, datasets, documentation, and discussions related to the project. We invite contributions and feedback from the community to improve the system and make news categorization in Sinhala more accessible.

Thank you for your interest, and we look forward to collaborating with you to enhance the accessibility and efficiency of Sinhala news consumption.
